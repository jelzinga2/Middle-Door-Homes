He helped lead the integration of the 30,000+ home Home Partners of America portfolio through the Blackstone/Tricon merger and drove $120M+ in annualized NOI growth. That work shaped a clear view: the institutional playbook for residential operations had never been packaged in a structure that worked for individual multifamily owners.

                Many small multifamily investors have spent years building a concentrated real estate
                position and kept managing it themselves because no institutional-quality structure
                for that equity existed. Middle Door Homes was built to change that: contribute your
                building and receive a passive stake in a diversified, professionally managed portfolio,
                with no taxable event at contribution.

                  A 721 exchange is an IRS-approved strategy that allows you to contribute your
                  building to a professionally managed portfolio in exchange for a passive ownership
                  stake, with no taxable event at closing. No capital gains. No depreciation
                  recapture.

                  Long-term owners carry decades of appreciation. Selling means a large, often

                  defers that entirely. Your equity rolls forward intact.

                Many small multifamily investors spent decades building a concentrated real estate
                position, and continued managing it themselves because no institutional-quality

                Our team has operated at 30,000+ units of institutional scale. We know what
                we&apos;re acquiring and what it takes to run it well. We bring that same operating
                playbook to small multifamily buildings, for the first time making it accessible
                to owners who built their positions outside the institutional market.
